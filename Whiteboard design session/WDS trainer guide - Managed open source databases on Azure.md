# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

- Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

- Stimulates the participant's thinking.

- Involves the participant in the learning process.

- Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

- Ensures individual participant accountability.

- Ties it all together for the participant.

- Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

- Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

- Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

- Effectively leads the feedback process.

## Whiteboard design session flow

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

- Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

- Current customer infrastructure and architecture

- Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

- Determine your target customer audience.

- Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

- Design and diagram your solution.

- Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

- Present solution

- Respond to customer objections

- Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

- Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

- Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

- Become familiar with all key points and activities.

- Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

- Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

- Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

- **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

- **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

- **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

**\*Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!\*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

## Abstract and learning objectives

\[insert what is trying to be solved for by using this workshop. . . \]

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1.  Meet your table participants and trainer.

2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Wide World Importers (WWI) is a traditional brick and mortar business with a long track record of success, generating profits through strong retail store sales of their unique offering of affordable products from around the world. They have a great training program for new employees, that focuses on connecting with their customers and providing great face-to-face customer service. This strong focus on customer relationships has helped set WWI apart from their competitors.

Over time, WWI modernized their business by expanding to online storefronts. During this expansion period, WWI experimented with various marketing tactics to drive online sales, from offering in-store shoppers special discounts online with promotional coupons after making a purchase, to running ad campaigns targeted toward customers based on demographics and shopping habits. These marketing campaigns proved successful, prompting WWI to invest more resources to these efforts and grow their marketing team.

Today, WWI has a host of online stores for various product offerings, from their traditional product catalogs offered by their physical storefronts, to specialized categories like automotive and consumer technology products. This expansion has made it more challenging to analyze user clickstream data, online ad performance, and other marketing campaigns at scale, and to provide insights to the marketing team in real-time.

Real-time marketing analysis is provided through interactive reports and dashboards on WWI's home-grown web platform, ReMarketable. This platform has served them well, but they are currently hindered by their inability to keep up with demand. ReMarketable's primary users are members of the marketing team, and the secondary users are shoppers on their various online platforms for whom website interaction behavior is being tracked. Other sources of data are fed from online ad data generated by ads run on social media platforms and email marketing campaigns. They use this type of data to evaluate ad effectiveness and customer reach, ultimately leading to sales conversions.

Their current challenges with ReMarketable are:

1. **Scale** - WWI is using a PostgreSQL database to store ReMarketable's data. Historical data is growing by over 2.9 GB rows of data per month. It is taking consistently longer to run complex queries. Queries that used to run in 3-5 seconds now take several minutes to complete. This is impacting their users' ability to evaluate up-to-date marketing and website use statistics. Instead of providing real-time reports for all users, they have to keep delaying report runs. They have scaled up their database, but this is becoming very expensive and they will soon hit a ceiling.
2. **Multi-tenancy** - The nature of their marketing and site usage data would benefit from multi-tenancy. Some storefronts generate considerably more data than others and have more marketing analysts that run reports on them than others. WWI believes sharding their database would help take the pressure off lower-volume data stores and also help them scale out. However, this will require re-engineering their database schema and client applications. In addition, sharding will require additional maintenance and increased complexity of aggregated views. These additional challenges and required resources are why they have not pursued this option yet.
3. **Process data while generating roll-ups** - Another byproduct of outgrowing their database is that WWI is having difficulty efficiently processing and ingesting streaming data, while at the same time generating pre-aggregated data for their dashboards. The Postgres engine is well-suited to handle multiple workloads simultaneously when the databases are properly configured and you are able to appropriately scale up or scale out to multiple nodes. WWI does needs help optimizing their database to handle these demanding workloads at scale. They have looked moving to a non-relational database to speed up queries, but that option added too much complexity to manage multiple databases, losing the ability to wrap their operations inside of transactions, re-architect their application, and migrate their historical data. In addition, they rely on Postgres' ability to create complicated ways of representing and indexing their data, which is impossible to do with a column store. Their need for high transaction volume and a real-time data set ruled out a lot of off-the-shelf data warehouses, where they would need to create a lambda architecture to handle both speeds of feeds.
4. **Resilient stream processing** - WWI is processing their streaming data through a web-based cluster that balances HTTP requests in round-robin fashion. When a node is processing the data and writing it to Postgres, subsequent requests are handled by available nodes. However, if processing fails for any reason, they risk losing that data and have no way to pick up where it left off. They have tried creating their own poison queue to reprocess these failed messages, but if the failed node is unable to add the data to the queue, then it is lost. The WWI technical team is aware of existing products and services that can help improve their stream processing and add resiliency, but they currently lack the skills and bandwidth to implement a solution for these complex scenarios. They are interested to see how Azure can help them rapidly create a solution for resilient stream processing and reduce their technical debt.
5. **Advanced dashboards** - WWI creates canned reports that are displayed on their ReMarketable website. However, their developers spend a lot of time creating new reports, owing to advanced charts, graphs, and other visualizations that are usually included. They would like a way to more rapidly create reports and be able to display them on a dashboard that can be customized and show real-time updates.

### Customer needs

1. Scale our marketing PostgreSQL database to handle high data growth while reducing the amount of time to run complex queries.

2. Shard our database so we can scale out, based on our tenants and their load requirements. We need a way to do this that will reduce schema changes, maintenance, and complexity of aggregated views.

3. Need a way to efficiently ingest and process streaming data, while at the same time generating pre-aggregated data for our dashboards.

4. During our stream processing, we sometimes encounter errors and have a difficult time recovering and continuing where we left off. We need a more resilient stream processing solution to reduce errors and prevent lost or duplicate data.

5. Would like a simple way to create powerful reports with a variety of visualizations. Ideally, this is something our analysts should be able to do against our live data sets.

### Customer objections

1. Does Azure offer a managed PostgreSQL database that can handle our scale requirements?

2. We are worried about the re-engineering effort involved in sharding our database, from modifying the schema to updating our applications to account for the changes.

3. Is there a way to migrate to PostgreSQL on Azure with minimal downtime?

4. We've looked at several PostgreSQL-based data platforms for adding enhancements like distributed data and scalability, but we are concerned about our existing applications being compatible and having access to the latest versions of PostgreSQL.
